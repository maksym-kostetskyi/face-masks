      <h2 class="about__title">N95 Respirators</h2>
      <p class="about__text">
        <strong>The N95 mask</strong> is a form of respiratory protective wear
        worn over the nose and mouth to help minimise the chance of inhaling
        airborne particles like viruses and other germs. It is a disposable mask
        made from synthetic polymer fibres produced in a highly specialised
        process called melt blowing. During this process, the inner layer of the
        N95 mask is created which forms the filtration layer capable of
        filtering out at <strong>least 95%</strong> of airborne particles when
        worn correctly.
      </p>
      <p class="about__text">
        During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods of intense
        air pollution, wearing <strong>N95 masks</strong> has been shown to help
        reduce the inhalation of compromised air, filtering out nasty pathogens
        which lead to illness or which can aggravate existing respiratory
        problems. Maintaining clear and unhindered respiration is vitally
        important for remaining fit and healthy and people with pre-existing
        conditions or respiratory fragility can particularly benefit from
        wearing face masks while they are out in public and unable to control
        the breathing environments that they find themselves in.

        N95 Respirators In Industrial And Health Care Settings
      </h2>
      <p class="about__text">
        Most <strong>N95 respirators</strong> are manufactured for use in
        construction and other industrial type jobs that expose workers to dust
        and small particles. They are regulated by the National Personal
        Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in the National Institute for
        Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which is part of the Centers for
        Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
      </p>
      <p class="about__text">
        However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health care
        setting. Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory protective
        devices used and worn by health care personnel during procedures to
        protect both the patient and health care personnel from the transfer of
        microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate material. These surgical
        N95 respirators are class II devices regulated by the FDA, under 21 CFR
        878.4040, and CDC NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84.
